# Recycle Me

## About the project

RecycleMe is a web application that aims to cultivate the public's awareness of recycling benefits and promote environmental protection. The app consists of 4 pages:

- Home - Daily news regarding recycling will be available here for users to explore the latest environment-related information.
- Recycle - Users can use our calculator to visualize how they could benefit from recycling in a quantitative way, more specifically,
how much electricity, carbon footprint and money they can save by recycling a certain category of product. 
- Achievement - A dashboard showing what the user has achieved so far in recycling waste, including how much progress they have made in the journey of recycling compared to last month and how much energy they have saved from it.  Most importantly, the user's effort in recycling will be converted to physical impacts where a tree will be planted across Singapore [in response to Singapore's one million tree movement](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement) This kind of reward could give users a unique sense of reward so that Moreover, a piechart showing the distrubution of waste recycled and a line chart to indicate trends in the quantity of waste recycled.
- Contact Us - For users to reach out to our team for any queries
